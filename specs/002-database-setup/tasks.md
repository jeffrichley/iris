- All file paths must be accurate and specific

## Task Validation

**Format Validation**: All 50 tasks follow the required checklist format:
- âœ… Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- âœ… Task ID: `T001`, `T002`, etc.
- âœ… Parallel marker: `[P]` where applicable
- âœ… Story label: `[US1]`, `[US2]`, etc. for user story phases
- âœ… Description: Clear action with exact file path
- âœ… File paths: Specific and accurate

**Completeness Validation**:
- âœ… Each user story has all needed tasks
- âœ… All tasks are independently executable
- âœ… Dependencies are clearly identified
