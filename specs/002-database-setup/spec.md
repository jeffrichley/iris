# Feature Specification: Database Setup

**Feature Branch**: `002-database-setup`
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to setup the db schema, db connections, and db models for interacting with the db."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Database Connection Establishment (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to establish secure database connections so that the application can persist and retrieve data reliably.

**Why this priority**: Without database connectivity, the application cannot function as a data-driven system. This is foundational infrastructure that all other features depend on.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying successful connection establishment, connection pooling, and basic query execution. Delivers immediate value by enabling data persistence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application starts, **When** it initializes the database connection, **Then** it successfully connects to the configured database
2. **Given** a database connection is established, **When** the application performs a simple query, **Then** it returns expected results without errors
3. **Given** multiple concurrent requests, **When** they access the database, **Then** connection pooling handles them efficiently without connection exhaustion

---

### User Story 2 - Database Schema Management (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to define and manage database schema so that data is stored in a structured, consistent format.

**Why this priority**: Schema definition is essential for data integrity and application functionality. Without proper schema, data cannot be reliably stored or retrieved.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tables, defining relationships, and verifying schema constraints. Delivers value by ensuring data consistency and structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new database, **When** schema migration is run, **Then** all required tables are created with proper structure
2. **Given** an existing database, **When** schema changes are applied, **Then** migrations run successfully without data loss
3. **Given** defined schema constraints, **When** invalid data is inserted, **Then** the database rejects the operation with appropriate error messages

---

### User Story 3 - Data Model Implementation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need to implement data models that provide a clean interface for database operations so that application code can interact with data in a type-safe, maintainable way.

**Why this priority**: While database connectivity and schema are foundational, data models provide the application layer interface. This enables clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating model instances, performing CRUD operations, and verifying data validation. Delivers value by providing a clean, type-safe interface for data operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a data model is defined, **When** a new instance is created, **Then** it validates required fields and enforces business rules
2. **Given** a data model instance, **When** it is saved to the database, **Then** the data persists correctly and can be retrieved
3. **Given** existing data in the database, **When** it is loaded into a model, **Then** all fields are populated correctly with proper data types

---

### User Story 4 - Database Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need to configure database settings for different environments so that the application can connect to appropriate databases in development, testing, and production.

**Why this priority**: Environment-specific configuration is essential for proper deployment and testing. This enables safe development practices and proper production deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying different configuration settings work in different environments. Delivers value by enabling proper environment separation and deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** different environment configurations, **When** the application starts, **Then** it connects to the correct database for that environment
2. **Given** database configuration changes, **When** the application restarts, **Then** it picks up new settings without requiring code changes
3. **Given** invalid database configuration, **When** the application starts, **Then** it provides clear error messages about configuration issues

---

### User Story 5 - Development CLI Tool (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need a command-line tool to manage database operations so that I can efficiently perform database setup, testing, and maintenance tasks during development.

**Why this priority**: While not critical for basic functionality, the CLI tool significantly improves developer experience and productivity. It enables efficient database management without requiring web interface access.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing CLI commands and verifying database operations complete successfully. Delivers value by providing a fast, reliable interface for database management tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the CLI tool is installed, **When** I run `iris-dev db test-connection`, **Then** it displays a progress bar and confirms database connectivity with rich output
2. **Given** database schema changes exist, **When** I run `iris-dev db migrate`, **Then** it shows migration progress with detailed status and applies changes successfully
3. **Given** database issues occur, **When** I run `iris-dev db health-check`, **Then** it provides detailed diagnostics with helpful error messages and suggested fixes

---

### User Story 6 - Database Health Monitoring (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need to monitor database health and performance so that I can identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

**Why this priority**: While not critical for basic functionality, monitoring is essential for production reliability and performance optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying CLI health check commands and monitoring metrics. Delivers value by enabling proactive issue detection and performance optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the CLI tool, **When** I run `iris-dev db health-check`, **Then** it returns the current status of database connectivity and performance
2. **Given** database performance metrics, **When** they are collected via CLI, **Then** they provide actionable insights about query performance and resource usage
3. **Given** database connection issues, **When** they occur, **Then** the CLI tool provides appropriate diagnostics and suggested fixes

## Codebase Structure

The database setup feature will be implemented using the following codebase structure:

```

    ├── widgets/            # Custom widgets
    └── utils/              # TUI-specific utilities
```

### Structure Rationale

- **Core separation**: Database infrastructure is isolated in `core/` for reusability
- **CLI independence**: CLI tool has its own directory to avoid TUI dependencies
- **Shared components**: Database models and configuration are shared between API and CLI
- **Modular design**: Each component can be developed and tested independently
- **Clear boundaries**: API, CLI, and TUI have distinct purposes and dependencies

## Dependencies

- Database server installation and configuration (PostgreSQL 12+ or SQLite 3.30+)
- Network connectivity between application and database
- Database user accounts with appropriate permissions
- Configuration management system for environment-specific settings
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure for health checks and performance tracking
- Rich logging library for CLI tool output and progress indicators
- Environment configuration file (.env) for database connection parameters
