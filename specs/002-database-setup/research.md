# Research: Database Setup

**Feature**: Database Setup
**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Decisions

## Technology Stack Research

### Database ORM: SQLAlchemy

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python database operations
- Excellent type safety with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Built-in connection pooling
- Alembic integration for migrations
- Cross-platform SQLite and PostgreSQL support

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Django ORM**: Too heavyweight for this project
- **Tortoise ORM**: Good async support but less mature ecosystem
- **Raw SQL**: Too low-level for maintainability

### Database Migration: Alembic

**Decision**: Alembic for database schema migrations
**Rationale**:
- Official SQLAlchemy migration tool
- Version-controlled schema changes
- Rollback capabilities
- CLI integration for development workflow

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Django migrations**: Django-specific, not applicable
- **Custom migration system**: Too complex for MVP
- **Manual schema management**: Error-prone and not scalable

### CLI Framework: Typer

**Decision**: Typer for CLI command structure
**Rationale**:
- Built on Click with modern Python features
- Excellent type hints support
- Rich integration for colored output
- Simple command structure for `iris-dev db` subcommands

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Click**: More verbose, less type-safe
- **argparse**: Too low-level for complex CLI
- **Rich CLI**: Good for display but limited command structure

### Rich Logging: Rich Library

**Decision**: Rich library for CLI output and progress bars
**Rationale**:
- Excellent progress bar support
- Colored output and formatting
- Terminal compatibility
- Lightweight and focused

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Colorama**: Basic color support only
- **Blessed**: Terminal manipulation but overkill
- **Custom formatting**: Too much development overhead

### Configuration Management: python-dotenv

**Decision**: python-dotenv for .env file support
**Rationale**:
- Simple environment variable management
- Standard .env file format
- Lightweight and focused
- Good integration with existing tools

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Pydantic Settings**: More complex than needed for MVP
- **ConfigParser**: File-based but not environment-focused
- **Custom configuration**: Too much development overhead

### Database Connection Pooling

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy built-in connection pooling
**Rationale**:
- Integrated with SQLAlchemy
- Configurable pool size and timeout
- Automatic connection management
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Custom connection pool**: Too complex for MVP
- **Third-party pooling**: Unnecessary complexity
- **No pooling**: Performance issues with concurrent operations

### Environment Configuration

**Decision**: Environment-based configuration with .env files
**Rationale**:
- Simple development and production setup
- Standard practice for Python applications
- Easy to override for different environments
- Secure credential management

**Alternatives considered**:
- **YAML configuration**: More complex than needed
- **JSON configuration**: Less readable than .env
- **Hardcoded configuration**: Not flexible for different environments

## Database Schema Design

### Table Relationships

**Decision**: Flexible foreign key relationships with nullable project references
**Rationale**:
- Supports both standalone and project-related entities
- Simple schema that's easy to understand
- Extensible for future requirements
- Clear data model for MVP

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Strict hierarchical structure**: Too rigid for flexible usage
- **No relationships**: Data integrity issues
- **Complex many-to-many**: Overkill for MVP

### Data Types

**Decision**: Standard SQL types with appropriate constraints
**Rationale**:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clear data validation
- Simple to implement and test
- Standard database practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Custom data types**: Too complex for MVP
- **JSON columns**: Less queryable than normalized structure
- **No constraints**: Data integrity issues

## CLI Tool Architecture

### Command Structure

**Decision**: `iris-dev db <subcommand>` structure
**Rationale**:
- Clear namespace separation
- Extensible for future database operations
- Consistent with development tool patterns
- Easy to discover and use

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Flat command structure**: Too many top-level commands
- **Nested subcommands**: Too complex for MVP
- **Separate tools**: Too much overhead

### Error Handling

**Decision**: Rich error messages with actionable guidance
**Rationale**:
- Improves developer experience
- Reduces support burden
- Clear debugging information
- Professional tool appearance

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Basic error messages**: Poor user experience
- **Silent failures**: Difficult to debug
- **Verbose logging**: Too much noise for CLI

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Decision**: pytest with SQLAlchemy test fixtures
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python testing
- Excellent database testing support
- Fixture-based test isolation
- Good integration with CI/CD

**Alternatives considered**:
- **unittest**: More verbose than pytest
- **Custom testing framework**: Too much development overhead
- **No testing**: Quality and reliability issues

### Integration Testing

**Decision**: Database integration tests with test database
**Rationale**:
- Validates real database operations
- Catches integration issues early
- Ensures CLI commands work end-to-end
- Confidence in deployment

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Mock database**: Doesn't test real database behavior
- **No integration tests**: Risk of runtime failures
- **Manual testing only**: Not scalable or reliable

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Pooling

**Decision**: 5 concurrent connections with 5-minute idle timeout
**Rationale**:
- Appropriate for single-user TUI system
- Prevents connection exhaustion
- Reasonable timeout for user sessions
- Simple configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- **No connection pooling**: Performance issues
- **Large connection pool**: Unnecessary resource usage
- **Short timeout**: Poor user experience with frequent reconnections

### Query Performance

**Decision**: Standard SQLAlchemy queries with appropriate indexing
**Rationale**:
- Good performance for expected data volume
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Standard database practices
- Easy to optimize later

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Complex query optimization**: Premature optimization
- **No indexing**: Poor query performance
- **Custom query layer**: Too complex for MVP

## Security Considerations

### Database Authentication

**Decision**: Standard username/password authentication
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and configure
- Standard database security practice
- Appropriate for local development
- Easy to extend with TLS later

**Alternatives considered**:
- **No authentication**: Security risk
- **Complex authentication**: Overkill for local development
- **Certificate-based auth**: Too complex for MVP

### Configuration Security

**Decision**: .env files with proper file permissions
**Rationale**:
- Standard practice for configuration management
- Easy to secure with file permissions
- Clear separation of sensitive data
- Simple to implement

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Hardcoded credentials**: Security risk
- **Complex secret management**: Overkill for local development
- **No configuration security**: Credential exposure risk

## Summary

The research phase has identified a solid technology stack for the database setup feature:

- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+** for ORM and database operations
- **Alembic** for schema migrations
- **Typer** for CLI command structure
- **Rich** for enhanced CLI output
- **python-dotenv** for configuration management
- **pytest** for comprehensive testing

This stack provides a robust foundation for the database infrastructure while maintaining simplicity and developer experience. All technology choices are well-established, have good documentation, and integrate well together.
