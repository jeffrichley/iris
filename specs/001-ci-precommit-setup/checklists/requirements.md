# Specification Quality Checklist: CI & Pre-commit Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 20, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All quality checks passed**

### Resolved Clarifications

**Dev Dependency Vulnerability Policy** (Resolved: October 20, 2025)
- **Decision**: Risk-based approach (Option C)
- **Policy**: HIGH/CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities in dev dependencies block merge; MEDIUM/LOW severity generate warnings but allow merge
- **Updated Requirements**: FR-029, FR-030 added to capture this policy
- **Edge Cases**: Updated with clear guidance

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and well-structured with 46 functional requirements
- User stories are properly prioritized and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- All clarifications resolved with risk-based security policy
- ✅ **Specification is READY for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)**
