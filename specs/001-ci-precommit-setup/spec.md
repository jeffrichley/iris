# Feature Specification: CI & Pre-commit Strategy

**Feature Branch**: `001-ci-precommit-setup`
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@CI_PRE_COMMIT.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Fast Feedback on Feature Branches (Priority: P1)

Developers working on feature branches receive immediate feedback on code quality issues before creating pull requests. When they push code to their feature branch, automated checks run quickly to catch common problems like linting errors, type checking issues, and test failures.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical story because it enables the fast feedback loop that prevents bad code from reaching code review. Without this, developers waste time in review cycles fixing preventable issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a feature branch, pushing code with intentional lint errors or type issues, and verifying that the CI workflow runs and reports the errors within a reasonable time (under 5 minutes).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a new feature branch, **When** they push code with a linting error, **Then** the CI workflow runs and reports the specific linting issue within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a developer pushes code with passing tests, **When** the CI workflow completes, **Then** they see a green status indicating their branch is ready for review
3. **Given** a developer is working on Windows/Mac/Linux, **When** they push code, **Then** the CI runs on their platform and reports any platform-specific issues

---

### User Story 2 - Protected Main Branch with Full Validation (Priority: P2)

When developers create a pull request to merge into the main branch, a comprehensive set of checks runs automatically including full test suite, security scans, and cross-platform validation. The main branch remains protected and cannot be merged until all checks pass and code review is approved.

**Why this priority**: This ensures the main branch always contains production-ready code. It's P2 because it builds on P1's fast feedback and adds comprehensive validation before merge.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pull request from a feature branch to main, verifying that all matrix jobs run across different OS and Python versions, and confirming that merge is blocked until all checks pass and approval is given.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a pull request to main, **When** the PR is opened, **Then** comprehensive CI runs including tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS with Python 3.12 and 3.13
2. **Given** a PR has failing security scans, **When** a developer tries to merge, **Then** the merge is blocked until vulnerabilities are resolved
3. **Given** a PR has all checks passing but no code review, **When** a developer tries to merge, **Then** the merge is blocked until at least one approval is received
4. **Given** a PR has passing checks and approval, **When** the developer clicks merge, **Then** the code is successfully merged to main

---

### User Story 3 - Local Pre-commit Quality Gates (Priority: P1)

Developers have automated pre-commit hooks installed locally that catch common issues before code is even committed. When they attempt to commit code, the hooks automatically format code, run linters, and perform type checking, either auto-fixing issues or blocking the commit if problems can't be auto-resolved.

**Why this priority**: This is P1 (equal to Story 1) because it provides the earliest possible feedback - before code even leaves the developer's machine. This saves CI resources and development time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing pre-commit hooks, attempting to commit code with formatting issues or type errors, and verifying that the hooks either auto-fix the issues or block the commit with clear error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has pre-commit hooks installed, **When** they commit Python code with formatting issues, **Then** the hooks auto-format the code and allow the commit
2. **Given** a developer commits Python code with type errors, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked with a clear message showing the type errors
3. **Given** a developer commits TypeScript code with ESLint errors, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** fixable errors are auto-corrected and the commit proceeds
4. **Given** a developer writes a commit message that doesn't follow Conventional Commits format, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked with guidance on the correct format

---

### User Story 4 - Standardized Commit Messages (Priority: P3)

All commits in the repository follow Conventional Commits format, making it easy to understand the history, generate changelogs, and track features and fixes. Developers are guided to write properly formatted commit messages through tooling that enforces the standard.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because while valuable for long-term maintainability and automation, it's not critical for the initial MVP. The project can function without perfect commit messages, but benefits greatly from having them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting commits with various message formats and verifying that only properly formatted messages (e.g., "feat(auth): add OAuth2 support") are accepted while improperly formatted messages are rejected with helpful guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer uses commitizen, **When** they initiate a commit, **Then** they are prompted with structured questions to build a properly formatted message
2. **Given** a developer writes a commit message without a type prefix, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked with an example of the correct format
3. **Given** a developer writes a properly formatted commit message manually, **When** they commit, **Then** the commit is accepted without additional prompts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer doesn't have pre-commit hooks installed locally but pushes code to a feature branch?
  - CI still catches issues, but developer misses early feedback
- What happens when CI matrix builds fail on only one OS/Python combination?
  - Entire build is marked as failed, blocking merge until platform-specific issue is resolved
- What happens when dependency security scans find vulnerabilities in dev dependencies but not production dependencies?
  - HIGH/CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities in dev dependencies block merge (security risk even in dev environment)
  - MEDIUM/LOW severity vulnerabilities in dev dependencies generate warnings but allow merge (can be addressed in follow-up)
- What happens when a large organization has many PRs running CI simultaneously?
  - GitHub Actions concurrency limits may queue builds; caching strategies minimize build time
- What happens when a developer force-pushes to a feature branch while CI is running?
  - GitHub Actions cancels the old workflow run and starts a new one for the latest commit
- What happens when CI fails due to infrastructure issues (GitHub Actions outage, timeout)?
  - Developer can re-run failed jobs; persistent failures should alert team
- What happens when test coverage drops below 80% threshold?
  - CI fails and blocks merge until coverage is restored

- **Quality Tool Configuration**: Settings files for linting (ruff, eslint), type checking (mypy, tsc), formatting (prettier), security scanning (bandit, npm audit, CodeQL), and commit standards (commitizen)

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers receive feedback on code quality issues within 5 minutes of pushing to a feature branch
- **SC-002**: All code merged to main branch has zero linting errors, zero type checking errors, and minimum 80% test coverage
- **SC-003**: 100% of commits in the repository follow Conventional Commits format after initial setup
- **SC-004**: Code passes quality checks on all three major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) and both supported Python versions (3.12, 3.13) before merge
- **SC-005**: Critical security vulnerabilities are detected and block merge to main 100% of the time
- **SC-006**: Developers can run all quality checks locally using simple commands (`just lint`, `just test`, `just type-check`, `just format`) that match CI behavior
- **SC-007**: Main branch maintains "pristine" state with no broken builds or failing tests at any point in time
- **SC-008**: Pull request review cycle time decreases by at least 40% due to catching common issues before human review (baseline will be measured after Workflow A deployment; metric tracked post-implementation)
- **SC-009**: CI build times are optimized through caching to average under 10 minutes for feature branch validation and under 15 minutes for full PR validation
