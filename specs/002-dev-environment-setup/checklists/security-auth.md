## OAuth2 Architecture Notes

**No Local Passwords**:
- All authentication via Google OAuth2
- No password complexity, reset, or verification requirements
- No local credential storage or validation

**Supabase-Managed Security**:
- Rate limiting: Managed by Supabase and Google default policies
- Token rotation: Automatic via Supabase refresh token flow
- Key management: Supabase handles JWT secret rotation

**OAuth2 Flow**:
1. User initiates sign-in → Supabase redirects to Google
2. Google auth consent → Callback to Supabase with auth code
3. Supabase exchanges code for tokens → Returns JWT to app
4. FastAPI validates JWT signature using Supabase public key

*This checklist tests the QUALITY of security requirements, not the implementation. Each item asks whether requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable - not whether the code works correctly.*
