# Specification Quality Checklist: Cloud-First Development Environment Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 20, 2025  
**Updated**: October 20, 2025 (Post Cloud-First Pivot)  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT**: This spec was completely rewritten to reflect cloud-first architecture (Supabase primary, no SQLite, no sync engine, authentication required).

## Content Quality

- [⚠️] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  
  **EXCEPTION**: Infrastructure spec requires specific technologies (Supabase Auth, FastAPI, Docker, JWT) as architectural decisions for Sprint 0 cloud-first pivot.
  
- [✅] Focused on user value and business needs  
  **VALIDATED**: Developer productivity (fast environment setup, hot-reload, clear auth flow) and secure user data isolation are business needs.
  
- [⚠️] Written for non-technical stakeholders  
  **EXCEPTION**: Primary audience is developers setting up infrastructure. Written in clear technical language appropriate for this audience.
  
- [✅] All mandatory sections completed  
  **VALIDATED**: User Scenarios (5 stories), Requirements (36 FRs), Success Criteria (10 SCs), Edge Cases (10 scenarios), Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope all present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [✅] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain  
  **VALIDATED**: All requirements are specific and unambiguous after clarification session.
  
- [✅] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
  **VALIDATED**: Each FR includes specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "completes in under 10 seconds", "returns 401 Unauthorized", "filters data by authenticated user_id").
  
- [✅] Success criteria are measurable  
  **VALIDATED**: All 10 SCs have quantitative metrics (2 minutes, 10 seconds, 2 seconds, 50ms, 5 seconds, 3 seconds, 100ms, zero bypasses, 30 seconds).
  
- [⚠️] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)  
  **EXCEPTION**: Infrastructure success criteria must reference specific technologies to be meaningful (e.g., "JWT validation completes in under 50ms", "Supabase connection check").
  
- [✅] All acceptance scenarios are defined  
  **VALIDATED**: 31 Given-When-Then scenarios across 5 user stories covering environment setup, database schema, authentication, API verification, and Docker.
  
- [✅] Edge cases are identified  
  **VALIDATED**: 10 edge cases documented covering credentials missing, connection failures, port conflicts, invalid JWTs, expired tokens, schema conflicts, Docker issues, version mismatches, RLS blocking.
  
- [✅] Scope is clearly bounded  
  **VALIDATED**: "Out of Scope" section clearly defines what's excluded (SQLite, sync, offline, CLI, frontend, OAuth, password reset, MFA, production deployment). "Future Considerations" documents Constitution and Architecture updates needed.
  
- [✅] Dependencies and assumptions identified  
  **VALIDATED**: Dependencies lists Supabase account, Docker, FastAPI libraries, Constitution principles. Assumptions documents cloud connectivity requirement, free tier usage, development-mode RLS policies.

## Feature Readiness

- [✅] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria  
  **VALIDATED**: 36 FRs map to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Each FR has clear pass/fail criteria.
  
- [✅] User scenarios cover primary flows  
  **VALIDATED**: 5 user stories prioritized P1-P3:
  - P1: Environment initialization (foundation)
  - P1: Supabase database schema (data layer)
  - P2: Supabase Auth integration (authentication)
  - P2: FastAPI JWT verification (API security)
  - P3: Docker Compose (deployment consistency)
  
- [✅] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria  
  **VALIDATED**: 10 success criteria with specific time/quality targets verifiable through testing.
  
- [⚠️] No implementation details leak into specification  
  **EXCEPTION**: See "Content Quality" note. Specific technologies are architectural requirements for cloud-first infrastructure.

## Cloud-First Pivot Validation

- [✅] SQLite references removed  
  **VALIDATED**: No SQLite database, schema, or file references remain. All data persistence through Supabase cloud.
  
- [✅] Sync engine requirements removed  
  **VALIDATED**: No local-to-cloud sync logic, timestamp comparison, or conflict resolution. Single source of truth in Supabase.
  
- [✅] Authentication added  
  **VALIDATED**: User Stories 3 & 4 cover Supabase Auth integration and JWT verification. 10 FRs dedicated to auth (FR-014 through FR-023).
  
- [✅] User isolation enforced  
  **VALIDATED**: All tables include user_id column (FR-010), RLS policies created (FR-013), protected endpoints filter by user_id (FR-025).
  
- [✅] Cloud connectivity assumed  
  **VALIDATED**: Assumptions section documents internet connectivity requirement. Edge cases handle connection failures gracefully.
  
- [✅] Just targets updated  
  **VALIDATED**: `just dev-setup` for initialization (FR-001), `just dev` for running services (FR-030). No `just dev-full` mentioned (can be added in planning).

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING** (with documented exceptions)

**Passing**: 14 / 17 checklist items  
**Exceptions**: 3 items (all related to technology-agnostic requirement for infrastructure work)

**Rationale for Exceptions**:  
Infrastructure specifications differ from user-facing feature specs in that they:
1. Target developers as users (not end users or stakeholders)
2. Specify architectural technology choices by design
3. Require technical language for precision

All exceptions are justified and do not impact spec quality for its intended purpose (Sprint 0 cloud-first infrastructure).

**Architecture Pivot Completed**: ✅
- Local-first → Cloud-first transformation complete
- All SQLite and sync references removed
- Authentication requirements added throughout
- User data isolation enforced in schema and API

## Notes

- **Ready for `/speckit.plan`**: No clarifications needed, all requirements clear and testable after user direction
- **Independent user stories**: Each story (P1/P2/P3) can be implemented and tested independently
- **Constitution update flagged**: "Future Considerations" documents Principle 1 update needed (Local-First → Cloud-First)
- **Architecture update flagged**: Spec notes Architecture.md needs update to reflect cloud-only data flow
- **Sprint 1 implications documented**: CRUD operations will work directly with Supabase, RLS policies will enforce user isolation
- **Iris CLI deferred**: User Story 4 (P4 priority) completely removed per user request to "polish later on"
- **MVP focused**: Stays within Sprint 0 scope, defers advanced features (OAuth, MFA, password reset) appropriately
