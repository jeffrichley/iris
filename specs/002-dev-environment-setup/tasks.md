# Tasks: Cloud-First Development Environment Setup

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-dev-environment-setup/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-spec.yaml, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Included per spec requirements (unit and integration tests for each user story)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each workflow.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Backend source: `src/iris/`
- Backend tests: `tests/`
- Configuration files at repository root
- Documentation in `docs/development/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3 - P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4 - P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories  
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5 - P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6 - P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) + User Story 2 (Phase 4) complete (needs database schema) + User Story 3 (Phase 5) complete (needs OAuth for JWT tokens)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7 - P3)**: Depends on User Story 4 complete (needs working API to Dockerize)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Critical Path**:
```
Phase 1: Setup
  ‚Üì
Phase 2: Foundational (BLOCKS EVERYTHING)
  ‚Üì
Phase 3: US1 (Environment Init) - Can run in parallel with US2, US3
Phase 4: US2 (Database Schema) - Can run in parallel with US1, US3
Phase 5: US3 (OAuth2 Auth) - Can run in parallel with US1, US2
  ‚Üì
Phase 6: US4 (FastAPI JWT) - DEPENDS on US2 + US3 (needs schema + auth)
  ‚Üì
Phase 7: US5 (Docker) - DEPENDS on US4 (needs working API)
  ‚Üì
Phase 8: Polish
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- US1, US2, US3 can all run in parallel after Foundational phase
- US4 must wait for US2 + US3
- US5 must wait for US4

**Recommended Order** (solo developer):
1. Setup ‚Üí Foundational (required)
2. US2 (Database) - Most foundational
3. US3 (OAuth2) - Needed for JWT tokens
4. US1 (Environment) - Can be done anytime, low dependency
5. US4 (FastAPI JWT) - Integrates US2 + US3
6. US5 (Docker) - Packages everything
7. Polish

### Within Each User Story

- Tests FIRST (write tests, verify they FAIL)
- Models in parallel (marked [P])
- Services after models
- Endpoints after services
- Integration tests verify story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Foundational Phase**:
```bash
# These can all run in parallel:
T008: Configure rich logging
T009: Create exception classes
T010: Create base SQLModel
T011: Create Supabase client
```

**User Story 2 (Database)**:
```bash
# All table definitions can run in parallel:
T025: projects table
T026: tasks table
T027: ideas table
T028: reminders table
T029: notes table
T030: indexes (after tables exist)
T031: RLS policies (after tables exist)
```

**User Story 4 (API Routes)**:
```bash
# After JWT validation exists, all routers can run in parallel:
T054-T059: projects router (all CRUD)
T060: tasks router
T061: ideas router
T062: reminders router
T063: notes router
```

**Documentation (Phase 8)**:
```bash
# All documentation updates can run in parallel:
T078: README update
T079: Supabase setup guide
T080: API docs link
T083: Constitution update
T084: Architecture update
```

- **[Story] labels** = Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **Tests FIRST** = TDD approach, write tests before implementation
- **Independent testing** = Each user story validates independently
- **Commit frequently** = Commit after each logical group of tasks
- **Stop at checkpoints** = Validate each user story works before moving to next

---
