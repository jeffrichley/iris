## üéØ **Command Overview & Execution Order**

### **The SpecKit Workflow** (Recommended Order)

Here's the typical flow for creating a feature:

1. **`/speckit.constitution`** - Project setup (ONE TIME)
2. **`/speckit.specify`** - Create feature spec (PER FEATURE)
3. **`/speckit.clarify`** - Refine spec (OPTIONAL, PER FEATURE)
4. **`/speckit.checklist`** - Validate requirements quality (OPTIONAL, PER FEATURE)
5. **`/speckit.plan`** - Create implementation plan (PER FEATURE)
6. **`/speckit.tasks`** - Generate task breakdown (PER FEATURE)
7. **`/speckit.analyze`** - Check consistency (OPTIONAL, PER FEATURE)
8. **`/speckit.implement`** - Execute implementation (PER FEATURE)

## üìù **Detailed Command Breakdown**

### **1. `/speckit.constitution` - Project Constitution** üèõÔ∏è

**Purpose**: Define your project's non-negotiable principles and rules (like coding standards, testing requirements, architecture constraints)

**Scope**: **ENTIRE PROJECT** (run once, update rarely)

**When to run**:

- At project start
- When major architectural principles change

**Output**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Key Features**:

- Defines principles (e.g., "Library-First", "Test-First", "CLI Interface")
- Sets governance rules
- Version-controlled constraints that all features must follow

---

### **2. `/speckit.specify` - Feature Specification** ‚úçÔ∏è

**Purpose**: Transform a natural language description into a structured feature spec

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE** ‚≠ê (This is your sprint/increment level)

**When to run**: At the start of each feature/story

**Input**: Plain English description (e.g., "I want to add user authentication")

**Output**:

- `specs/###-feature-name/spec.md` (requirements, user stories, success criteria)
- `specs/###-feature-name/checklists/requirements.md` (quality validation)

**What it does**:

1. Creates a feature branch
2. Generates user stories **with priorities (P1, P2, P3)**
3. Defines functional requirements
4. Creates acceptance criteria
5. **Self-validates** with a requirements quality checklist
6. Asks up to 3 clarifying questions if needed

**Key Features**:

- **BUSINESS-FOCUSED** (no technical details)
- Written for stakeholders, not developers
- User stories are **independently testable** (each can be an MVP)
- Maximum 3 clarification questions

---

### **3. `/speckit.clarify` - Spec Refinement** üîç

**Purpose**: Find and resolve ambiguities in your spec before planning

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE** (optional step)

**When to run**: After `/specify`, before `/plan` (if you want extra validation)

**What it does**:

1. Scans spec for ambiguities (vague terms like "fast", "scalable")
2. Asks up to 5 targeted questions (one at a time)
3. **Provides recommendations** for each question
4. Updates spec with clarifications incrementally

**Key Features**:

- Interactive questioning (one question at a time)
- AI recommends best answers based on best practices
- You can accept recommendations or provide custom answers
- Updates spec automatically after each answer

---

### **4. `/speckit.checklist` - Custom Quality Checklists** ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Generate domain-specific checklists to validate requirements quality

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE** (optional, run as needed)

**When to run**:

- After spec is written
- Before implementation
- For specific validation needs (UX, API, security, performance)

**Types of checklists**:

- `ux.md` - User experience requirements quality
- `api.md` - API requirements quality
- `security.md` - Security requirements quality
- `performance.md` - Performance requirements quality

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: These are **"Unit Tests for English"** - they validate if your requirements are well-written, NOT if the implementation works.

**Example items**:

- ‚úÖ "Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements?"
- ‚úÖ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?"
- ‚ùå NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly" (that's implementation testing)

---

### **5. `/speckit.plan` - Implementation Planning** üèóÔ∏è

**Purpose**: Create technical design from the spec

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE**

**When to run**: After spec is clarified and validated

**What it does**:

1. Fills in technical context (language, dependencies, stack)
2. **Phase 0**: Generates `research.md` (resolves unknowns)
3. **Phase 1**: Generates `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`
4. Verifies constitution compliance
5. Updates agent context

**Output**:

- `plan.md` - Technical approach
- `research.md` - Technical decisions and rationale
- `data-model.md` - Entities and relationships
- `contracts/` - API specs
- `quickstart.md` - Integration scenarios

---

### **6. `/speckit.tasks` - Task Generation** üìã

**Purpose**: Break down the plan into actionable, ordered tasks

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE**

**When to run**: After `/plan` completes

**What it does**:

1. Reads spec (user stories with priorities), plan, data-model, contracts
2. Generates tasks **organized by user story**
3. Each user story becomes an independent, testable increment
4. Shows dependencies and parallel opportunities

**Output**: `tasks.md` with:

- **Phase 1**: Setup (shared infrastructure)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- **Phase 3+**: One phase per user story (P1, P2, P3)
- **Final Phase**: Polish & cross-cutting

**Key Features**:

- Tasks formatted as checklists: `- [ ] T001 [P?] [US1?] Description with file path`
- `[P]` = parallelizable
- `[US1]` = belongs to User Story 1
- Each user story is **independently deliverable**

---

### **7. `/speckit.analyze` - Consistency Analysis** üî¨

**Purpose**: Cross-check spec, plan, and tasks for inconsistencies

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE** (optional, run after tasks are generated)

**When to run**: After `/tasks`, before `/implement`

**What it does**:

1. Detects duplication, ambiguity, coverage gaps
2. Checks constitution compliance
3. Maps requirements to tasks
4. Identifies unmapped tasks or requirements
5. **READ-ONLY** (doesn't modify files)

**Output**: Analysis report with:

- Findings table (severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Coverage summary
- Constitution violations
- Recommended next actions

---

### **8. `/speckit.implement` - Execution** üöÄ

**Purpose**: Execute all tasks from `tasks.md`

**Scope**: **PER FEATURE**

**When to run**: After tasks are generated and validated

**What it does**:

1. Checks checklist completion (warns if incomplete)
2. Loads all design docs
3. Sets up ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, etc.)
4. Executes tasks phase by phase
5. Follows TDD if tests are included
6. Marks off completed tasks in `tasks.md`

**Execution flow**:

- Phase 1: Setup
- Phase 2: Foundational (BLOCKS everything else)
- Phase 3+: User stories (can run in parallel)
- Final: Polish

## üéØ **Answering Your Key Questions**

### **1. Sprint vs Project Level?**

The system is designed for **INCREMENTAL, SPRINT-LEVEL** planning! üéâ

- **Project-level**: Only `/speckit.constitution` (one time)
- **Feature/Sprint-level**: Everything else (`/specify` ‚Üí `/plan` ‚Üí `/tasks` ‚Üí `/implement`)

Each **feature** gets its own spec in `specs/###-feature-name/` and is self-contained.

### **2. Small Incremental Planning (Your Preference!)**

This system **SUPPORTS YOUR PREFERENCE** perfectly! Here's how:

**Each feature spec contains user stories with priorities (P1, P2, P3)**:

- **P1 (User Story 1)** = Your MVP / First sprint
- **P2 (User Story 2)** = Second sprint
- **P3 (User Story 3)** = Third sprint

**You can implement incrementally**:

1. Run `/specify` once for the feature
2. Run `/plan` once to get technical design
3. Run `/tasks` to get ALL tasks (but organized by user story)
4. **Implement ONLY User Story 1** first (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3)
5. Test it independently
6. Then add User Story 2
7. Then add User Story 3

**Each user story is independently testable and deliverable!**

### **3. Avoiding "Too Much Planning"**

To keep planning **small and focused**:

‚úÖ **Do this**:

- Run `/specify` for ONE small feature at a time
- User stories should be **independently testable** (2-4 hours of work each)
- Skip `/clarify` if spec is clear enough
- Skip `/analyze` unless you need validation
- Start with just **User Story 1 (P1)** for implementation

‚ùå **Avoid this**:

- Don't create a spec for "entire authentication system" - break it down:
  - Feature 1: Basic login
  - Feature 2: Password reset
  - Feature 3: OAuth integration
- Don't try to plan 10 user stories at once

---

## üìä **Recommended Workflow for Small Increments**

### **Minimal Path** (Fastest)

```bash
/speckit.specify "Add basic user login"
# ‚Üí Creates spec with 1-3 user stories
/speckit.plan
# ‚Üí Technical design
/speckit.tasks
# ‚Üí Task breakdown by story
/speckit.implement
# ‚Üí Implement ONLY User Story 1 first!
```

### **Quality-Focused Path** (Recommended)

```bash
/speckit.specify "Add basic user login"
/speckit.clarify     # Optional: refine ambiguities
/speckit.checklist   # Optional: validate requirements
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.analyze     # Optional: check consistency
/speckit.implement   # Implement User Story 1 only
```

---

## üé® **Key Takeaway**

This system is designed for **feature-level, incremental planning**!

- Each feature = 1-3 user stories
- Each user story = independently testable increment
- You can implement one story at a time
- Perfect for avoiding "planning too much" problems
