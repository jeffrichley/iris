That makes total sense ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a **very sharp, architect-level call**. üëè

You‚Äôre absolutely right: a reliable natural-language-to-command parser is **a harder problem than spinning up a small, well-scoped agent layer** (especially since your system will already use LangGraph + MCP).

So:

> ‚úÖ Drop chat from the MVP.
> ‚úÖ Focus the MVP entirely on the **structured interface** (dashboard, projects, tasks, ideas, deadlines).
> ‚úÖ Add the agent layer **before** reintroducing chat ‚Äî because the chat UI will then have something meaningful to drive.

Let‚Äôs reframe the scope around that reality.

## üß© Updated MVP Focus (No Chat Yet)

### üéØ MVP Goal

> ‚ÄúGive me a single workspace where I can offload every project, task, and idea, track deadlines, and see my priorities clearly ‚Äî all through a clean, structured interface.‚Äù

### üíº Core Features

| Category                         | Description                                                                | Why It Matters                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projects**                     | Create, view, and manage projects. Each has description, tasks, and notes. | You need to track multiple ongoing efforts (C-SCAPE, Redwing, Iris itself). |
| **Tasks**                        | Add, edit, and complete tasks. Include deadlines and priority levels.      | Core productivity flow.                                                     |
| **Idea Inbox (Good Idea Fairy)** | Quick ‚Äúdumping ground‚Äù for ideas that can later be promoted to projects.   | Keeps inspiration from cluttering active work.                              |
| **Cross-Project Dashboard**      | One view that shows all projects, tasks, and upcoming deadlines.           | Gives situational awareness and helps manage workload.                      |
| **Reminders / Daily Summary**    | Email or in-app daily digest of what‚Äôs due, overdue, or new.               | Keeps you on track without remembering manually.                            |
| **Notes / Attachments**          | Add quick notes or attach reference materials per project.                 | Consolidates scattered context.                                             |
| **Meta Project (Dogfooding)**    | ‚ÄúProject: Iris‚Äù tracks its own development inside Iris.                    | Validates the product on itself.                                            |

### üß± Architecture Implications

* **Frontend:** Dashboard-first UI (Tauri + Svelte/React).
* **Backend:** Supabase for projects, tasks, ideas, and reminders.
* **Logic Layer:** Minimal orchestration; no intent parsing yet.
* **Agents:** Added next phase; they‚Äôll operate *on this same data layer*.

## ü™Ñ Phase Sequencing

| Phase       | Title                            | Core Focus                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0** | Vision & Architecture            | Define artifacts, finalize tech stack, and design UX wireframes.                                   |
| **Phase 1** | MVP ‚Äî Structured Project Manager | Projects, tasks, ideas, dashboard, reminders (no chat or agents).                                  |
| **Phase 2** | Agent Layer Integration          | Add lightweight LangGraph supervisor and 2‚Äì3 tools (task creation, prioritization, summarization). |
| **Phase 3** | Conversational Iris              | Introduce chat UI powered by the agent system.                                                     |
| **Phase 4** | Autonomous Iris                  | Proactive behaviors, natural planning, cross-tool orchestration.                                   |
