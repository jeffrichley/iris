# üß± Iris System Architecture ‚Äî Phase 1 MVP

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the architectural layout for the **Iris Phase 1 MVP** ‚Äî a structured project, task, and idea manager designed to help Jeff organize and prioritize work across multiple domains. The MVP excludes chat and autonomous agents, focusing on a reliable, local-first application with cloud synchronization.

---

## 2. System Overview

The MVP architecture is designed for **local-first operation** with seamless **cloud sync** and clear separation between the **frontend (UI)**, **backend (API)**, and **database** layers.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      Iris (Tauri App)                      |
|  React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Zustand + TanStack Query  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|           FastAPI Backend  (REST + WebSocket API)          |
|    - CRUD for projects, tasks, ideas, notes, reminders     |
|    - Local SQLite database                                 |
|    - Sync engine with Supabase cloud backend               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|          Supabase Cloud Backend (PostgreSQL + pgvector)    |
|    - Remote data sync + backup                             |
|    - Realtime events + authentication                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 3. Core Principles

| Principle               | Description                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local-first**         | All data lives locally first (SQLite). Cloud sync enhances reliability but is not required for daily use. |
| **Offline resilience**  | The system operates without internet; sync occurs when reconnected.                                       |
| **Cross-platform**      | Built with Tauri for macOS, Windows, and Linux.                                                           |
| **Scalable foundation** | Designed for easy introduction of agents, chat, and automation in later phases.                           |
| **Transparency**        | Iris stores data in user-accessible SQLite and Supabase instances.                                        |

### Relationships

- One project ‚Üí many tasks, notes, and reminders.
- Ideas may be converted to projects.
- Tasks optionally link to reminders.

## 6. Sync Flow

```
[Local SQLite] ‚Üê‚Üí [FastAPI Sync Module] ‚Üê‚Üí [Supabase PostgreSQL]
```

**Flow Description:**

1. User creates or updates local data.
2. FastAPI logs timestamp + hash.
3. Sync module detects new/changed entries.
4. Pushes to Supabase if newer; pulls updates if local copy outdated.
5. Supabase emits realtime event ‚Üí frontend updates via TanStack Query.

---

## 7. Reminders & Daily Briefing Engine

- Runs as a background task in FastAPI.
- Scans tasks/reminders due in next 24 hours.
- Sends desktop notifications and/or generates a summary view.
- Future phases may connect this to voice or email output.
