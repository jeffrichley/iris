# üó∫Ô∏è Iris Development Roadmap

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for **Project Iris**, starting with the Phase 1 MVP (structured interface) and progressing toward intelligent, autonomous functionality. Each phase adds capabilities while maintaining stability and usability.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

* **User-first:** Prioritize clear value for Jeff as the primary user before generalization.
* **Local-first:** Maintain offline functionality with seamless cloud synchronization.
* **Incremental intelligence:** Introduce AI and agents only after stable manual workflows.
* **Dogfooding:** Use Iris to manage Iris‚Äôs own development cycle.
* **Transparency:** Track every phase with living documentation (PRD, Architecture, Sprints, OKRs).

| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | Vision & Architecture      | Define vision, architecture, and documentation artifacts.                   | Clear product scope and technical foundation.       |
| **1** | MVP ‚Äî Structured Interface | Build UI and backend for managing projects, tasks, ideas, and reminders.    | Functional local-first project manager.             |
| **2** | Agent Integration          | Add LangGraph-based supervisor and simple agents (Task, Reminder, Summary). | Iris begins to assist and automate.                 |
| **3** | Conversational Iris        | Introduce chat interface powered by agent reasoning.                        | Natural interaction through text and voice.         |
| **4** | Cross-Integration Layer    | Connect with external tools (calendar, GitHub, Drive).                      | Iris operates across Jeff‚Äôs full digital ecosystem. |
| **5** | Autonomous Iris            | Proactive suggestions, scheduling, and self-improvement.                    | Self-managing, adaptive assistant.                  |

**Objective:** Introduce LangGraph supervisor and simple agents to automate repetitive tasks.

**Key Features:**

* LangGraph-based Task, Reminder, and Summary agents.
* MCP tool registry (get_tasks, add_task, summarize_notes).
* Agent can generate daily reports or summaries.
* `MCP_TOOLS.md` created and maintained.

**Deliverables:**

* MCP server and registry YAML.
* Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PRD.md`.
* Basic agent evaluation tests.

**Success Criteria:**

* Iris autonomously generates daily summaries.
* Agents execute CRUD operations via MCP tools.
* Iris can manage her own sprint updates.

---

## 7. Phase 3 ‚Äî Conversational Iris

**Timeline:** Mid 2026
**Objective:** Add chat interface to interact with Iris through natural language.

**Key Features:**

* Text chat UI.
* LangGraph conversation orchestration.
* Optional voice input/output (Whisper + Coqui).
* Chat actions mapped to existing MCP tools.

**Success Criteria:**

* Natural chat flow controlling all Iris functions.
* Voice optional but supported.
* Stable real-time event handling between UI ‚Üî backend.
