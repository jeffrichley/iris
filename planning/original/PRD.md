# üå∏ Iris Phase 1 MVP ‚Äî Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

**Product:** Iris ‚Äî Personal Project Management Assistant
**Version:** Phase 1 MVP (Structured Interface)
**Owner:** Jeff Richley
**Date:** October 2025

### Vision

Iris is designed to help you manage your complex ecosystem of projects, research efforts, and ideas without mental overload. The MVP focuses on creating a single, structured workspace to track projects, tasks, ideas, and deadlines ‚Äî before adding agents, automation, or chat.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

You are juggling multiple simultaneous projects (research, PhD, robotics, AI frameworks, content networks). Traditional tools (Trello, Notion, Todoist) require manual organization and lack cross-project awareness.

Iris should solve:

- Cognitive overload from remembering dozens of tasks and deadlines.
- Lost or scattered ideas from spontaneous inspiration.
- Difficulty balancing priorities and workload across projects.
- Lack of an integrated system that both stores and synthesizes project data.

---

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals

- Provide a **single, intuitive interface** for managing all ongoing and future projects.
- Enable structured **creation, tracking, and completion** of tasks.
- Offer a **Good Idea Fairy inbox** for idea capture and conversion to projects.
- Deliver **clear overviews** of progress, deadlines, and priorities.
- Support **daily briefings and reminders** to keep the user on track.

### Success Metrics

| Metric                                  | Target                                             |
